# Installing

If from GitHub:

Just copy the script `drauger-installer` into either `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or into `bin` in your home directory and the app is installed. You must run `drauger-installer` from the command line in order to install your \*.deb package

From \*.deb:

run `sudo apt install drauger-installer_(version)_all.deb` in the directroy you have downloaded the \*.deb file to. This will add a desktop file to `/usr/share/applications` to make Drauger Installer show up in your app menu, no matter what your desktop environment.
